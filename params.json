{"name":"Button-loader","tagline":"Button loader directive for angular","body":"# Button loader directive for angular\r\n\r\nThat is just another directive to manage button loaders, useful for wait times like ajax calls and so. Why create another directive fo this??? because I have not find anyone as simple as I need or as customizable as I want, so I decided to create my own.\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\n\r\nJust like any other angular directive, just include the ```btnLoader´´´ dependency on your Angular module:\r\n```\r\nvar myapp = angular.module('MyApp', ['btnLoader'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then use the html attribute \r\n```\r\n<button btn-loader  btn-condition=\"custom_condition\" >BUTTON </button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration options\r\n\r\nThe button loader is fully configurable fron html attributes. Below you can see the list of configurable options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbtn-loader  \t\t\t\t\t\t// Required to include the directive\r\nbtn-condition=\"custom_condition\"  \t// Set the variable to change state\r\nbtn-keepsize=\"true\"           \t\t// Keep the same size in both states\r\nng-disabled=\"custom_condition\" \t\t// Add disable state\r\nbtn-include=\"'noTemplate.html'\"\t\t// Add custom template\r\nbtn-texts=\"{load:'Load', loading: 'loading...'}\" \t\t\t\t\t// Fast customization for texts\r\nbtn-icons=\"{load:'fa fa-save', loading: 'fa fa-spinner fa-pulse'}\" \t// Fast customization for icons \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom Templates\r\nCustom templates give you the oportunity to make your own button loader fast and easy.\r\nCreate a template with both states and wrap them into tags with \"ng-hide\" and \"ng-show\" like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<span ng-hide=\"active\">\r\n\t<span>My custom text</span>\r\n\t<i>My custom icon</i>\r\n</span>\r\n<span ng-show=\"active\">\r\n\t<span>My custom text for waiting state</span>\r\n\t<i>My custom icon for waiting state</i>\r\n</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1> rafa</h1>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
